1. Violates: The code sample does not have a separate factory classmethod `from_connection_string` to create a client from a connection string. To fix this, add the following method to the `EventGridPublisherClientSync` class:

```python
@classmethod
def from_connection_string(cls, connection_string: str, **kwargs):
    endpoint, credential = cls._parse_connection_string(connection_string)
    return cls(endpoint, credential, **kwargs)
```

2. Does not violate: The class name `EventGridPublisherClientSync` has a "Client" suffix.

3. Does not violate: The constructor takes positional binding parameters (endpoint and credential), and a keyword-only argument for passing settings (options).

4. Violates: The constructor does not accept an optional `api_version` keyword-only argument of type string. To fix this, add the `api_version` parameter to the constructor:

```python
def __init__(
        self, 
        endpoint: str, 
        credential: Union[AzureKeyCredential, AzureSasCredential, TokenCredential], 
        options: ClientOptions,
        api_version: Optional[str] = None
    ) -> None
```

5. Not applicable: This guideline is for async clients, and the code sample is for a sync client.
